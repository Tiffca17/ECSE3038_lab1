Function #1: parallel()
  This function accepts any number of resistance values and prints the total resistance.

Function #2: potential_divider()
  This function accepts the voltage value and any number of resistance values and calculates the voltage drops across each resistor. It the prints the result.

Function #3: temperature_check()
  This function accepts the temperature value and a letter(common or capital) indicating whether the temperature is in celsius or fahrenheit. It then 
  prints whether the patient is hypothermic, hyperthermic or has a normal bodytemperature depending on the range that the value entered is in.
